# PlacePulse - A Social Platform for Sharing Places

## üåç Overview
**PlacePulse** is a web application designed to allow users to **share places they have visited** with others. Users can **sign up, log in, upload images, provide a title, description, and address for a place**, and explore locations shared by others. The platform encourages a community-driven approach to discovering new places, complete with **interactive maps** for visualizing shared locations.

This project is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with **Redux for state management**.

## üí° Skills Used
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Building RESTful APIs**
- Developed a fully functional backend with **Express.js and Mongoose**.
- CRUD operations for managing users and places.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Authentication with Token-Based Sessions**
- Used **JWT** for authentication, ensuring secure user sessions.

- **Backend:** Implemented validation in Express.js to prevent incorrect data submissions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Map API for Address Viewing**
- Integrated a **mapping API** to allow users to view locations they share.
- Converts text-based addresses into interactive map pins.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Image Upload Using Multer**
- Enabled **image uploads** for places using Multer.
- Stores images securely in the file system or cloud storage.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Environment Variables for Security**
